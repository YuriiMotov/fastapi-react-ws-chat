# FastAPI+ReactJS chat

This project implements (not yet) the chat functionality on Python and ReactJS that can be adjusted and extended according to your needs.

This is generally my study project where I'm practicing following Layered architecture to develop clear and flexible services, but I hope it can be useful for somebody.
